> **Every command, flag, option, and component explained with _WHY_.**  
> Learn Docker by understanding how it really works — not by memorizing commands.

## 🎯 What This Repository Is

This repository is a **hands-on, experiment-driven Docker book**, written for:

- Beginners who want **real understanding**
- Working engineers who want **confidence**
- Anyone tired of copy-paste Docker without knowing why it works

You will not just *use* Docker here —  
you will learn how to **reason about it like an engineer**.

## ❌ What This Repository Is NOT

- ❌ Not a Docker cheat sheet
- ❌ Not a certification cram guide
- ❌ Not Kubernetes (that’s **Volume 2**)
- ❌ Not theory without experiments
- ❌ Not “best practices” without explanation

If something cannot be **verified by experiment**, we don’t treat it as truth.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This book follows a strict mindset:

- **WHY before HOW**
- **Experiments before theory**
- **Observation before explanation**
- **Replace over repair**
- **Confidence over memorization**

Containers are treated as **Linux processes**, not magic or mini-VMs.
